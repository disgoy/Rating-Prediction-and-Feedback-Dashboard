To improve customer satisfaction and potentially attract more customers, the business team could consider adjusting their recipes to include a slightly higher amount of butter, or offer an optional butter side for customers who prefer a richer taste. This adjustment may help to cater to those who enjoy a more buttery flavor in their food, and could lead to positive word-of-mouth and increased customer satisfaction."
